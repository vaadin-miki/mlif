# MarkLogic Integration Framework

This small library makes it easier to install REST extensions and create connections to MarkLogic databases.

Please note that this is **work in progress**. Submit issues through GitHub.

# Getting started

The following properties must be defined:
    
    mlif.host=database-host-ip-or-name
    mlif.user=database-username
    mlif.password=database-password

Note that this file is not included in the repository. It also means you need to have a working MarkLogic database somewhere.

Please read the code in `MlifIntegrationTest.java` to get a glimpse of how to use this library.
